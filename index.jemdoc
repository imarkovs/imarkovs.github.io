== News

- January 2023: joining the [https://www.cimne.com/ International Centre for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE)] 

== Research

My research is in the areas of system theory, signal processing, and control. Its distinct feature is using behavioral approach, developed 40 years ago by Jan C. Willems, see
- [https://imarkovs.github.io/tutorial.pdf 2022 IEEE Control Systems Magazine tutorial], 
- [https://imarkovs.github.io/publications/overview-ddctr.pdf 2021 Annual Reviews in Control overview], and
- [https://imarkovs.github.io/book/book2e-2x1.pdf 2019 Springer monograph].

More specifically, my expertise is in
