  abstract = {We consider ARMAX system representations and identification problems. Identifiability conditions in terms of the correlation function of the process are given. One of the conditions is persistency of excitation of an input component of the process and another one is a rank condition for a pair of Hankel matrices.

We study the linear combinations of the process and its shifts that produce a process independent of the input. The set of all such linear combinations, called the orthogonalizers, has a module structure and under identifiability conditions completely specifies the deterministic part of the ARMAX system. Computing a module basis for the orthogonalizers is a deterministic identification problem.

We propose an ARMAX identification algorithm, which has three steps: first compute the deterministic part of the system via the orthogonalizers, then the AR part, which also has a module structure, and finally the MA part.}

  address = {Leuven, Belgium},
  abstract = {The stabilization diagrams, used in modal analysis, rely on the intuitive notion of a spurious pole. In this paper, we give a definition of a spurious pole, based on the most powerful unfalsified model (MPUM) of the data, i.e., on an exact model for the data. The poles of the MPUM are by definition physical and a pole that is not physical is by definition spurious. Our definition does not make assumptions about the data, apart from the basic postulation of the linear time-invariant model class. In this sense it is unprejudiced. Since the MPUM can be constructed from the data, one can compute the physical poles and thus answer the question in the title. If, however, one knows a priori that the data are noise corrupted trajectory of a true data generating system or that there is an unobserved process noise acting on the true system, one should use this knowledge. In this case, the MPUM concept has to be modified to allow for approximation. Methods for approximate system identification and model reduction are reviewed and applied for spurious pole detection of simulated data.},

The considered performance criterion is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement, defined as the ratio of the SNRs of the filtered signal and the given ECG signal. The empirical results show that for low SNR of the given signal, a band-pass filter yields the best performance, while for high SNR, an adaptive filter yields the best performance.}

  abstract = {An unorthodox programme for teaching systems and control is developed and tested at the School of Electronics and Computer Science of the University of Southampton. Motivation for the employed teaching methods is Moore's method and S. Papert's book “Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas”. The teaching is shifted from lecture instruction to independent work on computer based projects and physical models. Our experience shows that involvement with projects is more effective in stimulating curiosity in systems and control related concepts and in achieving understanding of these concepts. The programme consists of two parts: 1) analytical and computational exercises, using Matlab/Octave, and 2) laboratory exercises, using programmable Lego mindstorms models. Both activities cut across several disciplines - physics, mathematics, computer programming, as well as the subject of the programme - systems and control theory.},

The identification problem with missing data is equivalent to a Hankel structured low-rank matrix completion problem. The novel idea is to search systematically and use effectively completely specified submatrices of the incomplete Hankel matrix constructed from the given data. Nontrivial kernels of the rank-deficient completely specified submatrices carry information about the to-be-identified system. Combining this information into a full model of the identified system is a greatest common divisor computation problem. The developed subspace method has linear computational complexity in the number of data points and is therefore an attractive alternative to more expensive methods based on the nuclear norm heuristic.},

In particular, we show that the tensor low multilinear rank approximation problem can be reformulated as a structured matrix low-rank approximation, the latter being an extensively studied and well understood problem.

We first consider symmetric tensors. Although the symmetric tensor problem is at least as difficult as the general unstructured tensor problem, the symmetry allows us to simplify and clearly show the relation to the matrix structured low-rank approximation problem. By imposing linear equality constraints in the optimization problem, the proposed approach is applicable to unstructured tensors, as well as to affinely structured tensors. Therefore, it can be used to find (locally) optimal low multilinear rank approximation with a predefined structure. An advantage of the proposed approach is that it can deal with more difficult variations of the main problem, including having missing and fixed elements in the given tensor or approximating with respect to a weighted norm. The drawback is its higher computational cost, compared to existing algorithms, partially due to the generality of the approach.},

  abstract = {Operational modal analysis from impulse response data can alternatively be viewed as an identification of a stable autonomous linear time-invariant system. For example, earthquake response data of civil engineering structures and impulsive excitation of bridges leads to this problem. Identification from a single experiment, however, does not yield a consistent estimator in the output error setting due to the exponential decay of the noise-free signal. Using data from multiple experiments, on the other hand, is not straightforward because of the need to match the initial conditions in the repeated experiments. Consequently, we consider the identification from arbitrary initial conditions and show that consistent estimation is possible in this case. The computational method proposed in the paper is based on analytic elimination of the initial conditions (nuisance parameter) and local optimization over the remaining (model) parameters. It is implemented in a ready to use software package, available from \url{http://slra.github.io/software.html}},

In this paper, we propose an new approach to spurious poles detection that 1) has theoretical justification and 2) does not make unverifiable assumptions about the data generating system, apart form the basic one that it is linear time-invariant. The method is based on a quantitative measure of the distance of the identified model to a system with an eliminated spurious pole. Small distance indicates that the eliminated pole does not degrade the model quality. The procedure can be iterated for elimination of multiple spurious poles. An increase of the distance indicates that all spurious poles are eliminated from the model.},

It is well-known, e.g., that the standard implementations of the MOESP, N4SID or CVA algorithms yield biased estimates when closed-loop noisy data is considered. In order to bypass this difficulty, we follow the recent trends for closed-loop subspace-based model identification and suggest, in a first step, pre-estimating the innovation term from the available data. By doing so, the initial subspace-based identification problem can be written as a deterministic problem for which efficient methods exist. Once the innovation sequence is estimated, the second step of our subspace-based identification procedure focuses on the estimation of the open-loop and closed-loop system's Markov parameters. A constrained least-squares solution is more precisely considered to guarantee structural constraints satisfied by Toeplitz matrices involved the open-loop and closed-loop data equations, respectively. The performance of the methods is illustrated through the study of simulation examples under open-loop and closed-loop conditions.},

  abstract = {The paper considers the class of discrete-time, single-input, single-output, nonlinear dynamical systems described by a polynomial difference equation. This class, call polynomial time-invariant, is a proper generalization of the linear time-invariant model class. The identification data is assumed to be generated in the errors-in-variables setting, where the input and the output noise is zero mean, white, and the noise variances is known up to a scaling factor. The identification problem has two sub-problems
\begin{enumerate}
\item structure selection: find the monomials appearing in the difference equation representation of the system, and 
\item parameter estimation: estimate the coefficients of the equation. 
\end{enumerate}

The main result shows that the parameter estimation by minimization of the 2-norm of the equation error leads to unstructured low-rank approximation of an extended data matrix. The resulting method is computationally robust and efficient due to the use of the singular value decomposition. However, it requires knowledge of the model structure and even when the correct model structure is used, it leads to biased results. For the structure selection, the use 1-norm regularization is proposed. For the bias removal an adjustment of the ordinary least squares estimator is proposed. The resulting adjusted low-rank approximation methods defines an unbiased estimator for the model parameters of the polynomial time-invariant model. },

  abstract = {With the introduction of very dense sensor arrays in ultrasound (US) imaging, data transfer rate and data storage can become a bottle neck in ultrasound system design. To reduce the amount of sampled channel data, several strategies based on compressive sensing (CS) have been proposed. However, the reconstruction accuracy of CS-based methods is highly dependent on the sparse basis and the number of measurements for each channel cannot be lower than the sparsity thereby limiting the data reduction rate. Therefore, we propose to use a low-rank and joint-sparse model to represent US signals and exploit the correlations between adjacent receiving channels. Results show that the proposed method is better adapted to the ultrasound signals and can recover high quality image approximations from as low as 10\% of the samples.},

  abstract = {Applications of signal processing and control are classically model-based, involving a two-step procedure for modeling and design: first a model is built from given data, and second, the estimated model is used for filtering, estimation, or control. Both steps typically involve optimization problems, but the combination of both is not necessarily optimal, and the modeling step often ignores the ultimate design objective. Recently, data-driven alternatives are receiving attention, which employ a direct approach combining the modeling and design into a single step. In earlier work, it was shown that data-driven signal processing problems can often be rephrased as missing data completion problems, where the signal of interest is part of an incomplete low-rank mosaic Hankel structured matrix. In this paper, we consider the exact data case and the problem of simulating from a given input, an output trajectory of the unknown data generating system. Our findings suggest that, when using an adequate rescaling of the given data, the exact data-driven simulation problem can be solved by replacing the original structured low-rank matrix completion problem by a convex optimization problem, using the nuclear norm heuristic.},

The problem is to estimate the frequencies and corresponding amplitudes of a sum of (possibly complex-valued) sinusoidal components from noisy measurements. It can be solved with maximum likelihood methods or with suboptimal subspace methods. The constraint that the model does not have damping is difficult to impose in subspace methods. We develop an equivalent formulation as a structured low-rank approximation problem and present a necessary condition for the model to be undamped. The condition is that a vector in the kernel of  a Hankel matrix of observations has palindromic structure and it leads to a linear equality constraint which is easily incorporated into a numerical algorithm. Simulations show that even for relatively high noise-to-signal ratios, the necessary condition is in practice also sufficient, i.e. the identified model does not have damping.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear phenomena can be represented as nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) systems. NARX systems can be seen as a nonlinear version of linear infinite impulse response filter. Data-driven approaches are witnessing considerable interests in recent times and they are well-flourished for linear time-invariant systems. However, for nonlinear systems, they are still limited and attempts have been made to generalize the results for linear systems to nonlinear systems. In this paper, we study the problem of data-driven simulation for NARX systems: compute the output trajectory from a given input trajectory and initial conditions without explicitly identifying the parametric model; the model is implicitly identified by observed trajectory. Next, we develop an algorithm for the implementation of our approach. Finally, we illustrate the developed algorithm by numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {The paper demonstrates the claim in the title using missing data estimation as a generic example. The missing data estimation problem includes simulation, Kalman smoothing, and linear quadratic control as special cases. The solution method proposed uses an idea from subspace identification: under a persistency of excitation condition, the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from the data is equal to the behavior of the data-generating system. This fact allows construction of trajectories of the system directly from observed raw data. The construction of trajectories is the key for solving analysis, signal processing, and control problems without parametric model identification. The resulting methods require solution of systems of linear equations, however, the data is assumed exact and obtained from a linear time-invariant system.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of detecting the common dynamic among several observed signals. It has been shown in (Markovsky et al., 2019) that the problem is equivalent to a generalization of the classical Hankel low-rank approximation to the case of multiple rank constraints. We propose an optimization method based on the integration of ordinary differential equations describing a descent dynamic for a suitable functional to be minimized. We show how the proposed algorithm improves the numerical solutions computed by existing subspace methods which solve the same problem.},

  abstract = {There is a growing interest in data-driven control of nonlinear systems over the last years. In contrast to related works, this paper takes a step back and aims to solve the output matching problem, a problem closely related to the reference tracking control problem, for a broader class of nonlinear systems called output-generalized bilinear, thereby offering a new direction to explore for data-driven control of nonlinear systems. It is shown that discrete-time linear parameter-varying systems are included in this model class, with affine systems easily shown to also be included. The proposed model class and method are illustrated using the simulation of a real-life system.},

  abstract = {The Behavioral Toolbox is a collection of Matlab functions for modeling, analysis, and design of dynamical systems using the behavioral approach to systems theory and control. It implements newly emerged direct data-driven methods as well as classical parametric representations of linear time-invariant systems. At the core of the toolbox is a nonparameteric representation of the finite-horizon behavior by an orthonormal basis. The current version has education and research goals and isn't intended for handling "big data". The paper presents five problems---checking systems equality, interconnection of systems, errors-in-variables least-squares smoothing, missing input estimation, and data-driven forecasting---and describes their solution by the methods in the toolbox.}

  abstract = {Affine systems are ubiquitous in modeling and emerge naturally from the linearization of nonlinear dynamics. Despite their relevance in applications, their identification remains largely ad hoc, relying on centering the data before applying linear identification methods. This heuristic approach assumes constant offset and can introduce bias. We develop a dedicated framework for affine system identification, deriving identifiability conditions and identification methods based on difference equation representations. Unlike the classical two-step approach, our method identifies the data-generating system under conditions verifiable from data and system complexity. For noisy data in the errors-in-variables setting, we recast the problem as a structured low-rank approximation, leveraging existing optimization techniques for efficient computation.},

  booktitle = {Proc of the Conf. on Decision and Control},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {We propose a modeling framework for stochastic systems based on Gaussian processes. Finite-length trajectories of the system are modeled as random vectors from a Gaussian distribution, which we call a Gaussian behavior. The proposed model naturally quantifies the uncertainty in the trajectories, yet it is simple enough to allow for tractable formulations. We relate the proposed model to existing descriptions of dynamical systems including deterministic and stochastic behaviors, and linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space models with Gaussian process and measurement noise. Gaussian behaviors can be estimated directly from observed data as the empirical sample covariance under the assumption that the measured trajectories are from independent experiments. The distribution of future outputs conditioned on inputs and past outputs provides a predictive model that can be incorporated in predictive control frameworks. We show that subspace predictive control (SPC) is a certainty-equivalence control formulation with the estimated Gaussian behavior. Furthermore, the regularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) method is shown to be a distributionally optimistic formulation that optimistically accounts for uncertainty in the Gaussian behavior. To mitigate the excessive optimism of DeePC, we propose a novel distributionally robust control formulation, and provide a convex reformulation allowing for efficient implementation.},
