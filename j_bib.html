  abstract = {Supervisory hybrid systems are systems generating a mixture of continuous-valued and discrete-valued signals. This systems paradigm is particularly useful in modeling applications where high-level decision making is used to supervise process behavior. Hybrid system methodologies are also applicable to switched systems where the system switches between various setpoints or operational modes to extend its effective operating range. Hybrid systems, therefore, embrace a diverse set of applications. There has been considerable activity in the area of hybrid systems theory, and this article provides an introduction to some of the basic concepts and trends in this emergent field. The term hybrid refers to a mixing of two fundamentally different types of objects or methods. The paper deals with supervisory hybrid systems. Supervisory hybrid systems are systems that combine discrete event and continuous-valued dynamics. The article is organized as follows. We first provide an example of a hybrid system, to be used throughout as a pedagogical tool illustrating various concepts in hybrid systems theory. We then discuss modeling frameworks for hybrid systems, paying specific attention to the hybrid automaton. Not only may the system have a hybrid character, but the specifications on desired system behaviors may also be hybrid. The article also discusses specification logics that express system requirements on both the discrete and continuous states of the system. The article continues with a survey of current methods and concepts used to verify or validate desired system behaviors, and concludes with a survey of current methods for hybrid control system synthesis}

Some of the columns are observed without errors, and in addition the error covariance matrices may differ from row to row.

We give mild conditions for weak and strong consistency of the estimator, when the number of rows in $A$ increases.

We formulate a modified total least squares problem, called element-wise weighted total least squares, that provides a consistent estimator, i.e., the estimate~$\hat X$ converges to the true value~$X_0$ as the number of measurements increases. The new estimator is a solution of an optimization problem with the parameter estimate~$\hat X$ and the correction $\Delta D = [\Delta A \ \Delta B]$, applied to the measured data~$D=[A \ B]$, as decision variables. We derive an equivalent unconstrained problem by minimizing analytically over the correction~$\Delta D$ and propose an iterative algorithm for its solution, based on the first order optimality condition. The algorithm is locally convergent with linear convergence rate. For large sample size the convergence rate tends to quadratic.},

  abstract = {New algorithms for identification of a balanced state space representation are proposed. They are based on a procedure for estimation of the impulse response and sequential zero input responses directly from data. The proposed algorithms are more efficient than the existing alternatives that compute the whole Hankel matrix of Markov parameters. It is shown that the computations can be performed on Hankel matrices of the input-output data of various dimensions. By choosing wider matrices, we need persistency of excitation of smaller order. Moreover, this leads to computational savings and improved statistical accuracy when the data is noisy. Using a finite amount of input-output data, the existing algorithms compute finite time balanced representation and the identified models have a lower bound on the distance to an exact balanced representation. The proposed algorithm can approximate arbitrarily closely an exact balanced representation. Moreover, the finite time balancing parameter can be selected automatically by monitoring the decay of the impulse response. We show what is the optimal in terms of minimal identifiability condition partition of the data into ``past'' and ``future''.},

  abstract = {The maximum likelihood PCA (MLPCA) method has been devised in chemometrics as a generalization of the well-known PCA method in order to derive consistent estimators in the presence of errors with known error distribution. For similar reasons, the total least squares (TLS) method has been generalized in the field of computational mathematics and engineering to maintain consistency of the parameter estimates in linear models with measurement errors of known distribution. The basic motivation for TLS is the following. Let a set of multidimensional data points (vectors) be given. How can one obtain a linear model that explains these data? The idea is to modify all data points in such a way that some norm of the modification is minimized subject to the constraint that the modified vectors satisfy a linear relation. Although the name “total least squares” appeared in the literature only 25 years ago, this method of fitting is certainly not new and has a long history in the statistical literature, where the method is known as “orthogonal regression”, “errors-in-variables regression” or “measurement error modeling”. The purpose of this paper is to explore the tight equivalences between MLPCA and element-wise weighted TLS (EW-TLS). Despite their seemingly different problem formulation, it is shown that both methods can be reduced to the same mathematical kernel problem, i.e. finding the closest (in a certain sense) weighted low rank matrix approximation where the weight is derived from the distribution of the errors in the data. Different solution approaches, as used in MLPCA and EW-TLS, are discussed. In particular, we will discuss the weighted low rank approximation (WLRA), the MLPCA, the EW-TLS and the generalized TLS (GTLS) problems. These four approaches tackle an equivalent weighted low rank approximation problem, but different algorithms are used to come up with the best approximation matrix. We will compare their computation times on chemical data and discuss their convergence behavior.},

The weighted and structured total least squares problems have no such analytic solution and are currently solved numerically by local optimization methods. We explain how special structure of the weight matrix and the data matrix can be exploited for efficient cost function and first derivative computation. This allows to obtain computationally efficient solution methods. The total least squares family of methods has a wide range of applications in system theory, signal processing, and computer algebra.

  abstract = {The weighted low-rank approximation problem in general has no analytical solution in terms of the singular value decomposition and is solved numerically using optimization methods. Four representations of the rank constraint that turn the abstract problem formulation into parameter optimization problems are presented. The parameter optimization problem is partially solved analytically, which results in an equivalent quadratically constrained problem. A commonly used re-parameterization avoids the quadratic constraint and makes the equivalent problem a nonlinear least squares problem, however, it might be necessary to change this re-parameterization during the iteration process. It is shown how the cost function can be computed efficiently in two special cases: row-wise and column-wise weighting.},

  abstract = {The Maximum Likelihood PCA (MLPCA) method has been devised in chemometrics as a generalization of the well-known PCA method in order to derive consistent estimators in the presence of errors with known error distribution. For similar reasons, the Total Least Squares (TLS) method has been generalized in the field of computational mathematics and engineering to maintain consistency of the parameter estimates in linear models with measurement errors of known distribution. In a previous paper [M. Schuermans, I. Markovsky, P.D. Wentzell, S. Van Huffel, On the equivalance between total least squares and maximum likelihood PCA, Anal. Chim. Acta, 544 (2005), 254–267], the tight equivalences between MLPCA and Element-wise Weighted TLS (EW-TLS) have been explored. The purpose of this paper is to adapt the EW-TLS method in order to make it useful for problems in chemometrics. We will present a computationally efficient algorithm and compare this algorithm with the standard EW-TLS algorithm and the MLPCA algorithm in computation time and convergence behaviour on chemical data.},

In the special case of fitting by a static model, the data matrix and its low-rank approximation are unstructured.

We outline applications in system theory (approximate realization, model reduction, output error and errors-in-variables identification), signal processing (harmonic retrieval, sum-of-damped exponentials and finite impulse response modeling), and computer algebra (approximate common divisor). Algorithms based on heuristics and local optimization methods are presented. Generalizations of the low-rank approximation problem result from different approximation criteria (e.g., weighted norm) and constraints on the data matrix (e.g., nonnegativity). Related problems are rank minimization and structured pseudospectra.},

Some of the columns may be observed without errors, and in addition the error covariance matrix may differ from row to row. The columns of the error matrix are united into two uncorrelated blocks, and in each block, the total covariance structure is supposed to be known up to a corresponding scalar factor. Moreover the row data are clustered into two groups, according to the behavior of the rows of true $A$ matrix. The change point is unknown and estimated in the paper. After that, based on the method of corrected objective function, strongly consistent estimators of the scalar factors and~$X$ are constructed, as the numbers of rows in the clusters tend to infinity. Since Toeplitz/Hankel structure is allowed, the results are applicable to system identification, with a change point in the input data.},

Therefore, a global solution of the contour alignment problem can be computed efficiently.

  abstract = {Despite significant recent interest in the identification of electrically stimulated muscle models, current methods are based on underlying models and identification techniques that make them unsuitable for use with subjects with incomplete paralysis. One consequence of this is that very few model-based controllers have been used in clinical trials. Motivated by one case where a model-based controller has been applied to the upper limb of stroke patients, and the modeling limitations that were encountered, this paper first undertakes a review of existing modeling techniques with particular emphasis on their limitations. A Hammerstein structure, already known in this area, is then selected, and a suitable identification procedure and set of excitation inputs are developed to address these short-comings. The technique that is proposed to obtain the model parameters from measured data is a combination of two iterative schemes: the first of these has rapid convergence and is based on alternating least squares, and the second is a more complex method to further improve accuracy. Finally, experimental results are used to assess the efficacy of the overall approach.},

  abstract = {Rank deficiency of a data matrix is equivalent to the existence of an exact linear model for the data. For the purpose of linear static modeling, the matrix is unstructured and the corresponding modeling problem is an approximation of the matrix by another matrix of a lower rank. In the context of linear time-invariant dynamic models, the appropriate data matrix is Hankel and the corresponding modeling problems becomes structured low-rank approximation. Low-rank approximation has applications in: system identification; signal processing, machine learning, and computer algebra, where different types of structure and constraints occur. This paper gives an overview of recent progress in efficient local optimization algorithms for solving weighted mosaic-Hankel structured low-rank approximation problems. In addition, the data matrix may have missing elements and elements may be specified as exact. The described algorithms are implemented in a publicly available software package. Their application to system identification, approximate common divisor, and data-driven simulation problems is described in this paper and is illustrated by reproducible simulation examples. As a data modeling paradigm the low-rank approximation setting is closely related to the the behavioral approach in systems and control, total least squares, errors-in-variables modeling, principal component analysis, and rank minimization.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of optimization of a cost function on a Grassmann manifold. This problem appears in system identification in the behavioral setting, which is a structured low-rank approximation problem. We develop a new method for local optimization on the Grassmann manifold with switching coordinate charts. This method reduces the optimization problem on the manifold to an optimization problem in a bounded domain of an Euclidean space. Our experiments show that this method is competitive with state- of-the-art retraction-based methods. Compared to retraction-based methods, the proposed method allows to incorporate easily an arbitrary optimization method for solving the optimization subproblem in the Euclidean space.},

  abstract = {Subsampling of a linear periodically time-varying system results in a collection of linear time-invariant systems with common poles. This key fact, known as ``lifting'', is used in a two step realization method. The first step is the realization of the time-invariant dynamics (the lifted system). Computationally, this step is a rank-revealing factorization of a block-Hankel matrix. The second step derives a state space representation of the periodic time-varying system. It is shown that no extra computations are required in the second step. The computational complexity of the overall method is therefore equal to the complexity for the realization of the lifted system. A modification of the realization method is proposed, which makes the complexity independent of the parameter variation period. Replacing the rank-revealing factorization in the realization algorithm by structured low-rank approximation yields a maximum likelihood identification method. Existing methods for structured low-rank approximation are used to identify efficiently linear periodically time-varying system. These methods can deal with missing data.

We impose the low-rank by modeling the approximation as a product of two factors with reduced dimension. The structure of the low-rank model is enforced by introducing a regularization term in the objective function. The proposed local optimization algorithm is able to solve the weighted structured low-rank approximation problem, as well as to deal with the cases of missing or fixed elements.

This allows us to apply recent results on complexity and accuracy of computations for mosaic Hankel low-rank approximation. We develop optimization methods based on the variable projection principle.

  abstract = {The notion of the most powerful unfalsified model plays a key role in system identification. Since its introduction in the mid 80's, many methods have been developed for its numerical computation. All currently existing methods, however, assume that the given data is a /complete/ trajectory of the system. Motivated by the practical issues of data corruption due to failing sensors, transmission lines, or storage devices, we study the problem of computing the most powerful unfalsified model from data with missing values. We do not make assumptions about the nature or pattern of the missing values apart from the basic one that they are a part of a trajectory of a linear time-invariant system. The identification problem with missing data is equivalent to a Hankel structured low-rank matrix completion problem. The method proposed constructs rank deficient complete submatrices of the incomplete Hankel matrix. Under specified conditions the kernels of the submatrices form a nonminimal kernel representation of the data generating system. The final step of the algorithm is reduction of the nonminimal kernel representation to a minimal one. Apart from its practical relevance in identification, missing data is a useful concept in systems and control. Classic problems, such as simulation, filtering, and tracking control can be viewed as missing data estimation problems for a given system. The corresponding identification problems with missing data are ``data-driven'' equivalents of the classical simulation, filtering, and tracking control problems.},

  abstract = {In signal processing as well as in control and other mathematical engineering areas, it is common to use a model-based approach, which splits the problem into two steps: 1) model identification and 2) model-based design. Despite its success the model-based approach has the shortcoming that the design objective is not taken into account at the identification step, i.e., the model is not optimized for its intended use. In this paper, we propose an approach for data processing, called data-driven signal processing, that combines the identification and the model-based design into one joint problem. The to-be-computed signal is modeled as a missing part of a trajectory of the (unknown) data generating system. Subsequently, the missing data estimation problem is reformulated as a mosaic-Hankel structured matrix low-rank approximation and completion problem. A local optimization methods, based on the variable projections principle, is used for the numerical solution of the matrix completion/approximation problem. The missing data estimation approach for data-driven signal processing and the local optimization method for its implementation in practice are illustrated on examples of state estimation, filtering/smoothing, and prediction. Development of fast algorithms with provable properties in the presence of measurement noise and disturbances will make the matrix completion approach for data-driven signal processing a practically feasible alternative to the model-based methods.},

It is motivated by availability of information about the steady-state gain, overshoot, and rise time of the system, which in turn can be expressed as constraints on the impulse response. The method proposed has two steps: 1) estimation of the impulse response with linear equality and inequality constraints, and 2) realization of the estimated impulse response. The problem on step 1 is shown to be a convex quadratic programming problem. In the case of prior knowledge expressed as equality constraints, the problem on step 1 admits a closed form solution. In the general case of equality and inequality constraints, the solution is computed by standard numerical optimization methods.

  abstract = {Simultaneous fast and accurate measurement is still a challenging and active problem in metrology. A sensor is a dynamic system that produces a transient response. For fast measurements, the unknown input needs to be estimated using the sensor transient response. When a model of the sensor exists, standard compensation filter methods can be used to estimate the input. If a model is not available, either an adaptive filter is used or a sensor model is identified before the input estimation. Recently, a signal processing method was proposed to avoid the identification stage and estimate directly the value of a step input from the sensor response. This data-driven step input estimation method requires only the order of the sensor dynamics and the sensor static gain. To validate the data-driven step input estimation method, in this paper, the uncertainty of the input estimate is studied and illustrated on simulation and real-life weighing measurements. It was found that the predicted mean- squared error of the input estimate is close to an approximate Cramér-Rao lower bound for biased estimators.},

  abstract = {A structured errors-in-variables (EIV) problem arising in metrology is studied. The observations of a sensor response are subject to perturbation. The input estimation from the transient response leads to a structured EIV problem. Total least squares (TLS) is a typical estimation method to solve EIV problems. The TLS estimator of an EIV problem is consistent, and can be computed efficiently when the perturbations have zero mean, and are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d). If the perturbation is additionally Gaussian, the TLS solution coincides with maximum-likelihood (ML). However, the computational complexity of structured TLS and total ML prevents their real-time implementation. The least-squares (LS) estimator offers a suboptimal but simple recursive solution to structured EIV problems with correlation, but the statistical properties of the LS estimator are unknown. To know the LS estimate uncertainty in EIV problems, either structured or not, to provide confidence bounds for the estimation uncertainty, and to find the difference from the optimal solutions, the bias and variance of the LS estimates should be quantified. Expressions to predict the bias and variance of LS estimators applied to unstructured and structured EIV problems are derived. The predicted bias and variance quantify the statistical properties of the LS estimate and give an approximation of the uncertainty and the mean squared error for comparison to the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the structured EIV problem.},

  abstract = {A measurement is a dynamical process that aims to estimate the true value of a measurand. The measurand is the input that excites a sensor, and, as a consequence, the sensor output is a transient response. The main approach to estimate the input is applying the sensor transient response to another dynamical system. This dynamical system is designed by deconvolution to invert the sensor dynamics and compensate the sensor response. Digital signal processors enable an alternative approach to estimate the unknown input. There exists a data-driven subspace-based signal processing method that estimates a measurand, assuming it is constant during the measurement. To estimate the parameters of a measurand that varies at a constant rate, we extended the data-driven input estimation method to make it adaptive to the affine input. In this paper, we describe the proposed subspace signal processing method for the measurement of an affine measurand and compare its performance to a maximum-likelihood input estimation method and to an existing time-varying compensation filter. The subspace method is recursive and allows real-time implementations since it directly estimates the input without identifying a sensor model. The maximum-likelihood method is model-based and requires very high computational effort. In this form, the maximum-likelihood method cannot be implemented in real-time, however, we used it as a reference to evaluate the subspace method and the time-varying compensation filter results. The effectiveness of the subspace method is validated in a simulation study with a time-varying sensor. The results show that the subspace method estimation has relative errors that are one order of magnitude smaller and converges two times faster than the compensation filter.},

In this paper, we generalize this classical setup to what we call data-driven structured noise filtering. In the new setup, the noise has two components: structured noise, which is also a trajectory of a low-complexity linear time-invariant system, and unstructured noise, which is a zero-mean white Gaussian process. The key assumption that makes the separation problem in the new setup well posed is that among several experiments, the signal's dynamics remains the same while the structured noise's dynamics varies. The data-driven structured noise filtering problem then becomes a problem of estimation of common linear time-invariant dynamics among several observed signals. We show that this latter problem is a structured low-rank approximation problem with multiple rank constraints and use a subspace identification approach for solving it. The resulting methods allow computationally efficient and numerically robust implementation and have the system theoretic interpretation of finding the intersection of autonomous linear time-invariant behaviors. Statistical analysis of the methods providing confidence bounds is a topic for future research.},

This kind of problems arises in system identification, system theory and signal processing, where the rank constraints are typically “hard constraints”. To solve these problems, we propose a hybrid penalty method that combines a penalty method with a post-processing scheme. Specifically, we solve the penalty subproblems until the penalty parameter reaches a given threshold, and then switch to a local alternating “pseudo-projection” method to further reduce constraint violation. Pseudo-projection is a generalization of the concept of projection. We show that a pseudo-projection onto a single low-rank Hankel-structured matrix constraint can be computed efficiently by existing softwares such as SLRA (Markovsky and Usevich, 2014), under mild assumptions. We also demonstrate how the penalty subproblems in the hybrid penalty method can be solved by pseudo-projection-based optimization methods, and then present some convergence results for our hybrid penalty method. Finally, the efficiency of our method is illustrated by numerical examples.},

This paper shows how the approach can be used further on for solving interpolation, extrapolation, and smoothing problems.

In the case of exact data, we provide conditions for existence and uniqueness of solution. In the case of noisy data, we propose an approximation procedure based on \(\ell_1\)-norm regularization and validate its performance on real-life datasets. The method proposed outperforms model-based approaches. Procedures used in subspace identification, such as computation of a set of free responses and zero-initial conditions responses, are recovered as special cases of the data-driven interpolation method in the paper. The results have application in missing data estimation and trajectory planning. They open a practical computational way of doing system theory and signal processing directly from data without identification of a transfer function or state-space system representation.},

  abstract = {The behavioral approach to systems theory, put forward 40 years ago by Jan C. Willems, remained till recently an esoteric niche of research. The renewed interest in the last years is because of its unique suitability for the newly emerged data-driven paradigm, specifically the representation-free perspective on dynamical systems as sets of trajectories. A result derived in the behavioral setting that became known as the fundamental lemma started a new class of subspace-type data-driven methods. The fundamental lemma gives conditions for a non-parametric representation of a linear time-invariant system by the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from raw time series data. This paper reviews the fundamental lemma, its generalizations, and related data-driven analysis, signal processing, and control methods. A prototypical signal processing problem, reviewed in the paper, is missing data estimation. It includes simulation, state estimation, and output tracking control as special cases. The direct data-driven control methods using the fundamental lemma and the non-parametric representation are loosely classified as implicit and explicit approaches. Representative examples are data-enabled predictive control (an implicit method) and data-driven linear quadratic regulation (an explicit method). These methods are equally amenable to certainty-equivalence as well as to robust control. Emphasis is put on the robustness of the methods under noise. The methods allow for theoretical certification, they are computationally tractable, in comparison with machine learning methods require small amount of data, and are robustly implementable in real-time on complex physical systems.},

We illustrate our results with two methods from subspace identification and control: namely, subspace predictive control and low-rank approximation which constrain trajectories to be consistent with a non-parametric predictor derived from (respectively, the column span of) a data Hankel matrix. In both cases we conclude that direct and regularized data-driven control can be derived as convex relaxation of the indirect approach, and the regularizations account for an implicit identification step.

Moreover, the existing proofs do not clarify how conservative the assumptions are. We provide an alternative constructive proof that reduces the required order of persistency of excitation to the time horizon of the data-driven representation plus the controllability index of the system. The nongeneric case in which persistency of excitation of order more than the time horizon is needed corresponds to special initial condition. It is explicitly characterized in terms of the solution of a Sylvester equation. Another contribution of the paper is a representation of a persistently exciting input of a specified order as an output of an autonomous linear time-invariant system.

  abstract = {The behavioral approach to system identification starts from a given time series without a priori separation of the variables into inputs and outputs. The available identifiability conditions however require persistency of excitation of an input component of the time series which implicitly assumes that an input/output partitioning of the variables is given. In addition, a standard identifiability assumption is that the true data generating system is controllable. The conditions of controllability and persistency of excitation are sufficient but not necessary.

Motivated by the need to infer linear-time invariant models from rank deficient Hankel matrices and to use such matrices as data-driven predictors in signal processing and control, we derive necessary and sufficient identifiability conditions that do not require a priori given input/output partitioning of the variables nor controllability of the true system. The prior knowledge needed for identifiability is the number of inputs, lag, and order of the true system. The results are based on a modification of the notion of a most powerful unfalsified model for finite data and a novel algorithm for its computation. 

The results in the paper are derived assuming exact data, however, low-rank approximation allows their application in the case of noisy data. We compare empirically low-rank approximation of the Hankel, Page, and trajectory matrices in the errors-in-variables setting. Although the Page and trajectory matrices are unstructured, the parameter estimates obtained from them are less accurate than the one obtained from the Hankel matrix.

  abstract = {The existing nonparametric frequency response estimation methods suffer from leakage and have limited frequency resolution. Due to the leakage and interpolation errors these methods do not yield the correct result in case of exact data of a linear time-invariant system. Our main contribution is a nonparameteric direct data-driven frequency response estimation method that in case of exact data satisfying standard persistency of excitation condition eliminates the leakage and has infinite frequency resolution. The method is derived in the behavioral setting. It requires solving a system of linear equations and has no hyper-parameters. In case of noisy data, a modification of the method with low-rank approximation result in an effective frequency response estimator.},

  abstract = {We define and analyze the operations of addition and intersection of linear time-invariant systems in the behavioral setting, where systems are viewed as sets of trajectories rather than input-output maps. The classical definition of addition of input-output systems is addition of the outputs with the inputs being equal. In the behavioral setting, addition of systems is defined as addition of all variables. Intersection of linear time-invariant systems was considered before only for the autonomous case in the context of "common dynamics" estimation. We generalize the notion of common dynamics to open systems (systems with inputs) as intersection of behaviors. This is done by proposing a trajectory-based definition of these two basic operations. The main results of the paper are 1) characterization of the link between  the complexities (number of inputs and order) of the sum and intersection systems, 2) algorithms for computing their kernel and image representations and 3) show a duality property of the two operations. Despite these operations not being new to the literature, we highlight that the proposed approach is different, and based on polynomial computations and linear algebra.},

  abstract = {The identification problem in case of data with missing values is challenging and currently not fully understood. For example, there are no general nonconservative identifiability results, nor provably correct data efficient methods. In this paper, we consider a special case of periodically missing output samples, where all but one output sample per period may be missing. The novel idea is to use a lifting operation that converts the original problem with missing data into an equivalent standard identification problem. The key step is the inverse transformation from the lifted to the original system, which requires computation of a matrix root. The well-posedness of the inverse transformation depends on the eigenvalues of the system. Under an assumption on the eigenvalues, which is not verifiable from the data, and a persistency of excitation-type assumption on the data, the method based on lifting recovers the data-generating system.}

  abstract = {We revisit the problem of predicting the output of an LTI system directly using offline input-output data (and without the use of a parametric model) in the behavioral setting. Existing works calculate the output predictions by projecting the recent samples of the input and output signals onto the column span of a Hankel matrix consisting of the offline input-output data. However, if the offline data is corrupted by noise, the output prediction is no longer exact. While some prior works propose mitigating noisy data through matrix low-ranking approximation heuristics, such as truncated singular value decomposition, the ensuing prediction accuracy remains unquantified. This paper fills these gaps by introducing two upper bounds on the prediction error under the condition that the noise is sufficiently small relative to the offline data’s magnitude. The first bound pertains to prediction using the raw offline data directly, while the second one applies to the case of a low-ranking approximation heuristic. Notably, the bounds do not require the ground truth about the system output, relying solely on noisy measurements with a known noise level and system order. Extensive numerical simulations show that both bounds decrease monotonically (and linearly) as a function of the noise level. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that applying the de-noising heuristic in the output error setup does not generally lead to a better prediction accuracy as compared to using raw data directly, nor a smaller upper bound on the prediction error. However, it allows for a more general upper bound, as the first upper bound requires a specific condition on the partitioning of the Hankel matrix.},
